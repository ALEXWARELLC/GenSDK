# GenSDK
A general use library for developers to use to compute functions in C# which may take time to implement.

This software is licensed under the GNU General License. For more information, [See the full license](https://github.com/ALEXWARELLC/GenSDK/edit/main/LICENSE).

## Getting Started
Before you begin using GenSDK, you'll need to know a few things.

1. GenSDK is a .NET (Non Framework) library. You cannot use this library in a .NET Framework application until a First or Third Party library is produced.
2. It is recommended that you use the [NuGet Package Manager](https://nuget.org) to add GenSDk to your project. This saves any missing references when working with other developers.
3. GenSDK uses [FodyWeavers from Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody/tree/master) when making a build from source code.
